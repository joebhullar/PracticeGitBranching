THIS Is the REAL CONFLICT ON LINE 22 6:28PM
To branch in Git simply use checkout command with -b option:

*git checkout -b my_awesome_branch
-JOES CHANGE WITH NANCY AT 621PM
*To check what branch you're on, you can simply type: git status

Merge a branch into another, first make sure you are on the branch that you want to merge to. Let's say you want to merge the my_awesome_branch branch into master. First make sure you're on the master brach: git checkout master

NOW that we are ON THE BRANCH THAT WE WANT TO MERGE TO (my_awesome_answer) 	USE THE git merge my_awesome_branch command this will merge the branch into the master branch.
